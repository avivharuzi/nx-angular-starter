## 🎢 Getting Started

- Replace all `nx-angular-starter` and `nxAngularStarter` keyword from this project with your new project name, for example: `my-website` and `myWebsite`
- Replace `apps/nx-angular-starter/src/favicon.ico` with your website favicon
- Replace `apps/nx-angular-starter/src/assets/icons` with your website icons
- Update this `README.md` file according to your project changes
- If you are using monorepo multi-package repository consider removing `husky` (git hooks) npm package to prevent conflicts between repos, I recommended deleting `.husky` directory, remove npm `prepare` script and run: `npm uninstall husky` and then maybe to add `husky` in the root of the project
